An proximity geo-location gate triggering system, based on BLE.

This project is built for an ESP32 running with the arduino framework. The project is being developed in Visual Studio Code.
It essentially provides a framework for remote triggering applications - such as when you come home, a gate opens.

Future work will investigate trilateration by using multiple base stations to approximate a more exact position.
